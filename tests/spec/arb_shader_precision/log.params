1.00000012e+00 //the smallest positive float that causes log() to produce a positive result
9.99999940e-01 //the largest positive float that causes log() to produce a negative result (log(x) crosses 0 at 1)
3.40282347e+38 //FLT_MAX - produces the largest log value
1.17549435e-38 //FLT_MIN - produces a large negative log value, although subnormals could produce even more negative results
